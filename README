# spmetro

It is a Prolog script which is intended to find the fastest path between
two stations in SÃ£o Paulo Subway System, given an hour of a day.

It is known that there are times of the day which it is crowded and taking
a train can take longer than at normal conditions. Also, it should
consider the time of swapping lines. Some stations are bigger and so, the
time spent will be longer.
